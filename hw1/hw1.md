Problem 1

Find three simple functions from R^2 to R and suitable points that are:

    a local minimum
    a local maximum
    neither a minimum nor maximum, but the gradient is zero at this point.

Plot these functions using 3D plots as in the notebooks for creating density and contour plots and three dimensional plots. Indicate clearly the points. Use 2d and 3d contour plots.

Problem 2

Extend the notebook for solving linear regression using stochastic gradient descent to the case where there are two weights w1 and w2 and one bias term b.

Problem 3

What does an average MNIST digit look like? For each i=0,1,...,9, compute the average of digit i and display it.

Check out Colab notebook for loading and exploring the MNIST digits data set.
